#  What is the Event Loop? üîÅ

The event loop is JavaScript's way of managing multiple tasks while maintaining its single-threaded nature. It ensures non-blocking execution by moving tasks between different queues and executing them based on priority. 

> Components of the Event Loop üèóÔ∏è

1Ô∏è‚É£ Call Stack üìö - Executes JavaScript code synchronously. \
2Ô∏è‚É£ Web APIs üåç - Handles async operations like setTimeout, fetch, and DOM events. \
3Ô∏è‚É£ Callback Queue (Task Queue) üéüÔ∏è - Stores callbacks from Web APIs (e.g., setTimeout). \
4Ô∏è‚É£ Microtask Queue üöÄ - Stores promises (.then, catch, finally). Has higher priority than the Callback Queue. \
5Ô∏è‚É£ Event Loop üîÑ - Continuously checks the Call Stack and pushes pending tasks from queues when it's empty. 

> How the Event Loop Works üîÑ

‚Ä¢  Executes all synchronous code in the Call Stack.

‚Ä¢  Moves asynchronous tasks (like setTimeout) to Web APIs.

‚Ä¢  When async tasks are completed, their callbacks go to either Microtask Queue (Promises) or Callback Queue (setTimeout, event listeners, etc.).

‚Ä¢  The Event Loop first clears the Microtask Queue before moving to the Callback Queue.

‚Ä¢  This process repeats indefinitely. üîÉ

Example to Understand Event Loop Priorities 
```jsx
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise resolved"));

console.log("End");
```
üí° Output:
```
Start
End
Promise resolved
setTimeout
```
‚úÖ Even though setTimeout has a 0ms delay, the Promise microtask executes first because Microtask Queue has higher priority than the Callback Queue.




>#  Task Execution Priorities 

JavaScript follows a priority system for executing tasks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Synchronous Tasks (Highest Priority) üî• \
2Ô∏è‚É£ Microtasks (Promises, MutationObserver) üöÄ \
3Ô∏è‚É£ Callback Queue Tasks (setTimeout, event listeners) üéüÔ∏è \
4Ô∏è‚É£ Rendering Tasks (Repaints, reflows) üé®

Example with Different Tasks:
```jsx
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise resolved"));

document.body.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Clicked!"));

console.log("End");
```
üí° If you click the screen, the output will follow:
```
Start
End
Promise resolved
setTimeout
Clicked! (after user click)
```
‚úÖ Event listeners are handled in the Callback Queue and executed when triggered.

>#  Rendering and Event Loop 

JavaScript also prioritizes UI rendering efficiently. The browser follows these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Executes all synchronous JavaScript. \
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clears Microtask Queue first. \
3Ô∏è‚É£ Renders UI (if needed). \
4Ô∏è‚É£ Executes Callback Queue tasks. \
5Ô∏è‚É£ Repeats the process. üîÑ
