Hi there! I'm Karan, a Software Developer passionate about building software and web applications. I also enjoy DevRel activities, such as writing technical blogs and tutorials on software development, full-stack development, and blockchain.

## Purpose of This Tutorial

While building projects, I realized that understanding multiple approaches to solving problems in tech is invaluable. It provides deeper insights into core implementations and helps track the evolution of technology, such as new libraries or frameworks.

In this tutorial series, I'll cover web development concepts essential for building SaaS applications or your own web products. This includes both frontend and backend development, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of full-stack technologies.
