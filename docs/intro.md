# Welcome to Karan Tutorial's

Hi there! I'm Karan, a Software Developer who likes building softwares and web stuff.
I also like doing DevREl stuff that includes writing tech blogs and tutorials of softwares, full-stack development, blockchain.

## What is this Tutorial for

When building things I realized it's always good to know all possuble approaches of doing things in tech because it gives you more exposure to core implementation and helps understanding the evolvement of tech for ex new library or framework. 
I will try to include webdeb related stuff which is required to build Saas or your own web product this includes both frontend and backend.
